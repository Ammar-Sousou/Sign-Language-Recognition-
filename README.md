# Sign-Language-Recognition-using-Transfer-Learning

A project that was built in order to convert sign language into a readable and audible text, so that it would be a link between us and the deaf and dumb of people of determination.

The project was built based on transfer learning, using the famous VGG16 neural network. The parameters were carefully tuned in order to obtain the best results in the shortest possible training time (the model was trained in less than 12 hours on more than 70,000 images)
